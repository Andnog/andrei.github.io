## Project Overview

The **Secure Chat Application** is an advanced messaging system built in Java, designed to demonstrate the practical application of cryptographic techniques in ensuring secure communication. The project includes a client-server architecture, a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for certificate and key management, and multiple encryption methods for message confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

---

### Goals

- Enable secure communication between users.
- Implement cryptographic protocols to safeguard messages.
- Develop a comprehensive PKI for managing public keys and digital certificates.

---

## Key Features of the Secure Chat Application

1. Cryptographic Techniques
The project implements the following encryption methods:

- **Plaintext Messages**:
  - Messages sent without any encryption (for demonstration purposes only).
  
- **Symmetric Encryption**:
  - Utilizes a shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt messages.
  - Keys are exchanged securely using the PKI.

- **Asymmetric Encryption**:
  - Messages are encrypted with the sender's private key and decrypted using the recipient's public key.

- **Digital Signatures**:
  - Ensures message authenticity and integrity by hashing the message and encrypting the hash with the sender's private key.

- **Digital Envelopes**:
  - Combines symmetric encryption for message content and asymmetric encryption for the symmetric key.

2. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
The PKI acts as the backbone for managing cryptographic keys and certificates. It includes:

- **Certificate Authority (CA)**:
  - Issues and manages digital certificates.
  - Associates public keys with user identities.

- **Key Management**:
  - Stores and updates public/private key pairs.
  - Facilitates secure key exchanges between users.

3. Client Application
The client application supports the following features:

- **User Registration**:
  - Registers user information along with their public/private key pairs.
  - Generates digital certificates for authentication.

- **Messaging**:
  - Sends and receives messages with options to select encryption levels.
  - Validates digital signatures and decrypts messages using appropriate methods.

- **Contact Management**:
  - Allows users to add and manage contacts securely.

- **Session Initialization**:
  - Uses a secure authentication protocol with two-factor authentication.

4. Server Component
The central server manages client connections and facilitates secure communication. Its responsibilities include:

- Storing and forwarding messages.
- Maintaining user data and certificates.
- Interfacing with the PKI for key retrieval and validation.

## Implementation Details

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java.
- **Networking**: Sockets and threads for client-server communication.
- **Database**: Embedded databases for storing user credentials, messages, and certificates.

### Protocols and Security Mechanisms
1. **Authentication Protocol (PFS)**:
   - Ensures secure user authentication with two factors.
   - Prevents unauthorized access to the system.

2. **Message Structure**:
   Each message is an object containing:
   - Content code (indicates the type of service).
   - Sender and receiver identifiers.
   - Message content (encrypted or plain).
   - Event ID for tracking and validation.

---

## Cryptography in Action

1. **Key Exchange**
- Public/private key pairs are generated during user registration.
- Keys are securely shared using the PKI.

2. **Message Encryption**
- *Symmetric Encryption*: Fast and efficient for large messages.
- *Asymmetric Encryption*: Adds security for key exchange and digital signatures.

3. **Digital Signatures**
- Ensures that the sender is authenticated.
- Detects any tampering with the message content.

4. **Digital Envelopes**
- Combines the speed of symmetric encryption with the security of asymmetric encryption.
